        Hello world!
        Odin Lachlan McDonald.
        I'm playing the soundtrack from 'The Matrix' as I complete this git assignment. It makes me feel like a professional. 
        Quick shoutout to my main main Mike Colbert. I enjoyed his teaching style from Data Wrangling, which was one of the main reasons I chose his elective course from the rest. 
        So far, I think I'm getting the hang of it!
